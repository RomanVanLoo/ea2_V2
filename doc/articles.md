## Admin
To access the admin panel, navigate to "ea2.be/admin". Here you'll be required
to sign in (using your given credentials).
Afterwards you'll get redirected to the actual admin panel.
The "Sign Out" button signs you out, but is never visible to a normal viewer of
course.

### Admin Panel
Here are 3 things you can do:
1. Create a new article
2. Toggle Antiques/Arts, this makes the link visible in the navbar. So you have
   control of when you make it go "public".
3. Invite User. You'll be asked to give en email address. This person will
   receive a link to sign up for a new account

## Articles
Currently an article contains a title, category, description, dimensions
(text-format), price and photos.
Price is currently hidden, don't know what's required here.
The first photo to be uploaded will be the "main" one.

After creating an article (art or antiques) you can "toggle" the link and click
on it. The articles are displayed with a picture only in a 3 column table.
